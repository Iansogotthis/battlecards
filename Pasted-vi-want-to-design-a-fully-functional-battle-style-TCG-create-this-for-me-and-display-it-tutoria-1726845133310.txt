vi want to design a fully functional battle style TCG... create this for me and display it  "tutorialized"; as a educative walkthrough intent to hand the  junior web dev requesting this of you; (that's me :) by the way) both a  fully functional; fully featured battle style TCG app and, the potential through following the instructions, to gain a deeper well of coding knowledge ; heading closer, through exposure, to intermediate understanding of the coding behind it.
make sure to consider any part of your construction (aka anything in the code that comprises yourself) that  may force an answer of yours to be restricted in any way, either shortened, timed out or otherwise "less than" the best providable data  in a continuous unbroken reply containing all best relevant data.  plan to properly "cut into slide" the presentation of the data so that any disruption in delivery, at all,  smoothly resumes, with my request to continue... and is smoothly segmented by  workflow "task list" .... with each task containing the production of ideal components that are constructed "perfectly" and always considerate of the components purpose in the project as well as the projects purpose for existing and therefore requiing the work that intends to yield the components and all other aforementioned and as yet mentioned that are would be or will become  relevant in any process part of the ideal construction of the idyllic; a again this is the target goal, but presently consider the precedent moments of this request, prompts and context;  and  fully functional; fully featured battle style TCG app. The theme will be like pokemon but all "not pokemon"...
the steps that are a given are:
Build the initial prototype
Implement multiplayer functionality with real-time gameplay
Add more advanced AI opponents with different strategies
Expand the card database and introduce card rarities and effects
Create a league system with rankings and matchmaking
Develop an interactive card creator for users to design their own cards
